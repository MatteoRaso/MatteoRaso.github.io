It clicked to me that the reason is because western culture isn't really that formal. Maybe that sounds obvious to some people, but as somebody who's been exclusively raised in western culture, it actually came as a bit of a shock. Fashion is pretty much the only place in western culture where there's a big focus on adhering to strict social protocols, but because formal clothing is worn based on how formal an event is, these social protocols literally don't matter at all. No matter how formal an event is, you're probably going to be wearing a suit and tie, which is actually considered casual. There's a few circumstances where you're expected to wear a tuxedo (which is considered semi-formal), but there's very few people that will ever be invited to a white-tie event, which is full formal. This is all a carryover from a time where western society cared about formality. I honestly think it's good that we don't focus so much on formality anymore, but I think it's cool that we can see how society has evolved through small details and understand things about our culture that we normally take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Blockbuster Was Right To Not Buy Netflix</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/why-blockbuster-was-right-to-not-buy-netflix.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-08-13:/why-blockbuster-was-right-to-not-buy-netflix.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, you see people talk about how Blockbuster not buying Netflix was one of the worst financial decisions in history.

That's arguable, but what people are usually trying to say is that Blockbuster made a &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; decision, and anybody with a brain would have taken the deal. I want to push back on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal in question was an offer to buy Netflix for $50,000,000 back in 2000. It's been quite a while, but I'm sure most people who were alive back then have some vague memory of dialup internet. If you don't, the key takeaway is that it was slow, very slow. You weren't watching any shows you got online unless you spent literal hours downloading it. Streaming requires downloading footage at least as fast as you watch it, so that wasn't an option at all. Even though it's now known for streaming, the business model for Netflix at the time was to mail out DVDs that were ordered on the internet. When the customer was done with them, they mailed the DVDs back. It worked well, but it wasn't the revolutionary change that made Netflix into a billion dollar company. At the time that the offer was made, the economy was in a recession because the dot-com bubble burst and countless promising internet startups were going under. From the perspective of Blockbuster, you have an internet startup with an easily replicated business model that had a massive chance of going under in a year offering to let you buy them so they won't become a competitor in case they survive. Even though they were wrong, it made perfect sense to think that Netflix wouldn't become an issue for them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anybody who was alive at the time can tell you, Blockbuster didn't quickly die after passing up that deal. Shortly after this happened, Blockbuster entered the online DVD rental business themselves, even becoming a serious competitor to Netflix. They also started to offer streaming services in 2007 as soon as the technology was ready, just like Netflix. The reason why people don't mention this, I think, is because streaming was still rare back in 2007 and because Blockbuster was already starting to lose its popularity before streaming even became a thing. Either way, it's not like Blockbuster stubbornly sat still while Netflix (and nobody else) went ahead to pioneer movie streaming. If Blockbuster actually had purchased Netflix, there's a good chance that some other company would have beaten Blockbuster on streaming and killed the company themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real reason for why Blockbuster died isn't really clear. Some people say that it was bad leadership, other people say that it was because of excessive late fees, but I don't think anybody who wasn't there when it happened really knows. Personally, I think Netflix had fairly little to do with it. All I know is, the death of Blockbuster wasn't because of a small mistake that only seems dumb in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Recap Of The Reddit Blackout</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/recap-of-the-reddit-blackout.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-07-24:/recap-of-the-reddit-blackout.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The blackout seemed to have taken the internet by storm, but not much has been heard about it since. Now that things seem to have mostly been resolved, I want to give an overview of what happened and my thoughts about it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why The Blackout Happened&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The blackout seemed to have taken the internet by storm, but not much has been heard about it since. Now that things seem to have mostly been resolved, I want to give an overview of what happened and my thoughts about it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why The Blackout Happened&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don't remember or didn't hear about it when it was happening, the Reddit blackout was a mass protest over Reddit's API changes. Previously, access to the API was free, which allowed 3rd party developers to use it to create bots and their own apps for Reddit. However, the CEO of Reddit announced that anybody using more than 100 API calls a minute would have to pay $0.24 for every 1000 API calls. This meant that a very popular 3rd party iOS app for Reddit called Apollo would have to pay $20,000,000 a year. Obviously, not exactly spare change. The developer announced that he would shut down the app on June 30th, which prompted a massive backlash against Reddit. The mods for most of the largest subreddits decided to take all their subreddits and make them private for 2 days, effectively shutting down the entire website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why Do People Care This Much About An App?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Reddit got a redesign that proved to be very unpopular. Not only did the redesign replace the classic UI that Reddit had from the start, the redesign was a lot more resource-intensive than the older UI. This made for a website that was a lot less responsive and downright inaccessible for people with old hardware or bad internet. The redesign was widely considered ugly and filled with antipatterns, prompting many users to avoid it as much as possible. To put it in the words of /u/all_copacetic, &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/NJ3cr"&gt;"Words can't describe how much I hate new reddit. I was actually deeply saddened by the thought  that I'd never be able to experience old reddit again. As if a friend had died. I hope to fuck they never remove the option of opting out of the ugly, slow new design."&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, while it's still possible to use the old UI, it occasionally forces you into the new UI, which makes it annoying to use. At the same time, part of the new redesign was constant notifications asking you to use the offical app, which many users considered to be annoying and an antipattern. This could be prevented with 3rd party apps, but the API change was going to ruin all that, and many users felt that the API change was designed solely for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why That Isn't Why People Cared&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous section wasn't wrong, but it lacks context. Most people didn't use 3rd party apps, especially Apollo, which is only available on iPhones anyways. A lot of the backlash boiled down to an aversion to what is seen as corporate greed, Reddit's classic love of using the website for mass protest movements, and just because the users with the most power on the website were dragging everybody along with them. The last reason is an important one. Reddit relies on volunteer users to moderate the subreddits, which gives a minority of users a lot of power over how the website is run. Even if people disagree with what the mods do, they don't really have a choice but to go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why Reddit Wasn't Entirely Wrong&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API change came way too fast, but charging for API access isn't unreasonable. These changes only affect heavy users, and apps designed for accessibility will be exempt. If I was a CEO of a massive company, I wouldn't want people to make money by using my infrastructure without paying anything back, either. The pricing is definitely too high, but not enough to completely kill the apps. All you would need to do is kill the free-tier for your app, reduce the number of API calls as much as you can, and you'd still be able to profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why The Mods Were Very Wrong&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of people pointed out, a 2 day strike is nothing. Some of the mods understood that and decided to go on strike indefinitely, but a lot of them reopened their subreddits as planned. This completely killed the strike, but that's not what I find interesting about all of this. Apparently, a lot of the mods ultimately decided to reopen their subreddits because &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/reddit-ceo-threatens-to-boot-moderators-who-back-blackout-protest"&gt;the CEO threatened to take away their mod rights.&lt;/a&gt; That's right: they reopened their subreddits because the Reddit CEO threatened to take away their unpaid job. Wow, such a scary situation to find yourself in /s. Another weird thing that the mods did was coming up with alternative means of protesting, like spamming &lt;a href="https://uproxx.com/viral/john-oliver-reddit-protest/"&gt;pictures of John Oliver.&lt;/a&gt; I don't know what the plan was there, but Reddit corporate doesn't care that you've posted a picture of John Oliver. What they do care about is increasing the number of people that post on Reddit, so you're literally just rewarding them. All in all, this strike reflected very poorly on the mods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Twitter Situation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I started to come up with this post, &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/twitter/twitter-crisis-explained-what-are-rate-limits-and-when-will-they-end"&gt;Twitter began to rate-limit itself,&lt;/a&gt; causing a massive drop in usage. As I began to write this paragraph, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/24/elon-musk-rebrands-twitter-to-x-replaces-iconic-bird-logo.html"&gt;Twitter killed its iconic brand.&lt;/a&gt; Now that Meta has created Threads to be ~~Twitter's~~ X's first major competitor, it's clear that ~~Twitter~~ X will never be the powerhouse it once was, if it even survives the next couple of years. It's just a coincidence that this happened at the same time as the Reddit fiasco, but it does show that social media is changing massively all at once. Nobody really knows what the future holds for social media, but it certainly feels like we're moving even further away from the era where social media was about the users. Hopefully this leads users to move away for greener pastures, because a website designed to extract as much value out of you at all costs isn't a website worth using.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Fire</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/fire.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-06-26:/fire.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I went on the shortest walk I've been on in months.

Social media and the like have always been bad for you, but short form
content like literally everything found on Tiktok is like cyanide for
your attention span. I refuse to use the app, but it's hard to avoid
the problems of Tiktok when the internet is being consumed by Tiktok.
This isn't Tiktok's fault, they're just running their own app, but 
it's hard to ignore how the content that originates on Tiktok spreads.
Just about every video-sharing website (including websites you don't
normally think of as video-sharing websites, like Reddit and Facebook)
has been flooded with mirrors of Tiktok videos. These videos tend to
be the ones that blow up the most, because short-form content is the
most addictive, creating a feedback loop where people only look for
videos that match Tiktok's short-form style. Youtube is awful for this,
since it shoves Youtube Shorts down your throat. I try to block them,
but Youtube won't let you, since they know these videos are the ones
that keep you glued to the website. I know some people have the
self-control to avoid clicking on any of them, but I don't. I know that
there needs to be personal responsibility and all that, but you
can't tell people to exercise personal responsibility when websites
literally go out of their way to make it difficult for you to block
addictive content. I might just cut Youtube out of my life, honestly.
I've already deleted accounts for a lot of social media sites, and
while it can be pretty boring without a dripfeed of content at all
hours, I don't think a more boring life is a worse one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>When Adding A Recovery Option Makes Things Worse</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/when-adding-a-recovery-option-makes-things-worse.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-05-05:/when-adding-a-recovery-option-makes-things-worse.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I added a recovery phone number to my gmail

there's no reason to think that somebody coming back to an account

think that your company was hacked. Pro-tip, you can keep your users's

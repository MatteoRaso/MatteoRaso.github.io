  <div>
    <p>With all the hype (and fear) about ChatGPT and existential threats caused
by AI, I think it'd be good for society as a whole to take a step back and
calmly analyse what AI are. No matter how advanced they are, they're just
really big equations filled with matrix multiplication and non-linear
activation functions. No matter how accurate they are, I don't think an
equation can ever be called intelligent. I don't think an equation can
even emulate intelligence that well. For an equation to be used to solve
a problem, an intelligent agent has to actually decide that the equation
can be used to solve the problem and then use a computer to do the
calculations. I think that autonomy is an essential aspect of intelligence,
which an equation will never emulate, much less have. I don't want to say
that AI doesn't have the potential to be dangerous, especially in the hands
of a bad actor, but I don't think we'll ever have to worry about one of the
AI programs becoming sentient.</p>

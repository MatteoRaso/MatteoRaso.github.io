            An Unusual Git Error I Got, And How to Fix it
        </h2>

        <paragraph>
            I was working on this game I've been programming for a while 
            when I decided to add a little feature to let the player 
            check how good the armor that they're wearing actually is. I 
            commit, check the 'git status' to see if there was anything 
            that I was missing, found nothing, and pushed to my Github 
            repo. All in all, a pretty normal experience, until I 
            noticed an extremely abnormal bug. Instead of pushing my 
            code, Git said "fatal: unable to read 'messed_up_hash'". 
            For some 
            reason I still don't understand, Git expected the commit 
            to be under a different hash than the one it was actually 
            under. A bit unusual, so I look up solutions. I find several 
            solutions to fix corrupted objects, but none of them worked 
            for me, since they assume that the hash is actually there (I 
            checked my .git directory, there really wasn't a hash 
            there). This brought me to what looked like the only 
            solution I hadn't tried: delete the repo, pull from Github, 
            and accept losing your unpushed commits. This isn't exactly 
            a bad solution, since it works and it's easy to do, but it 
            assumes best practice. I have (or at least had, now that 
            this scare has fixed me up) a habit where I let commits pile 
            up before pushing. This is not best practice. I had 8 
            commits piled up, one of which was extremely important and 
            took a considerable amount of time to figure out. Dumping it 
            wasn't an option as far as I'm concerned.

            Here I decided to keep looking for solutions to my problem. 
            Thankfully, I found one other person who had my exact same 
            problem: Jim Schubert. In a 2012 post on <a href="https://www.ipreferjim.com/2012/02/git-push-fatal-unable-to-read-sha1/"> ipreferjim.com </a>,
            almost down to the exact same day that I had the problem, 
            Jim outlines a way to fix the problem by writing the hash 
            to Git. It's a reasonable fix, but with one problem: it 
            didn't work on my repo. Again, no idea why, since there's 
            no reason why it wouldn't work, but computers don't always 
            act in logical ways. Yet again, I had to search for 
            answers.

           Suddenly, it hit me: why not just get rid of the commit? I 
           use 'git reset' to remove it, only to find out that it needs 
           the non-existent hash in order to remove it. Great. At this 
           point, I'm trying to find out how to remove a commit without 
           directly interacting with the commit when I finally find my 
           solution: backup the problematic file, use 'git rm' to get 
           rid of it, use your text editor of choice on the copy to 
           undo whatever changes you made, rename the copy as the 
           original file, use 'git add', and then run 'git commit 
           --amend --allow-empty'. Your commit still stays, and will 
           probably always stay, but now Git won't give you any 
           problems about missing hashes. After running those commands, 
           I was finally able to push to my Github repo. Here's hoping 
           I never have to do this again.

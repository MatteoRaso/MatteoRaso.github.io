</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As I get back into Minecraft, I'm reminded by how awesome the cliff update
was. It's genuinely breathtaking to see the new overworld terrain generation
while exploring my world. Sadly, I've found myself in a situation where I
have to be reminded that the cliff update was paired with a cave update.
I can understand why people (maybe even most people) would like the cave
update, but it's caused me nothing but grief. I have a horrible sense of
direction, so bad that I struggled to navigate caves with the old world
generation. Now that caves are massive, trying to not get lost is pointless.
Instead, I minimize the amount of mining that I need to do by using automatic
farms that get me the things that I need. Still, I do sometimes have to go
mining, so I dig quarries. This was hard enough back in the good old days,
but at least you would only have to deal with fairly small pockets of space
beneath your feet. Now, you have to deal with a massive cavern that you're
going to drop into. When you've dug up all the upper part of the quarry, you
either have to leave the quarry unfinished, or you have to jump into the
cavern and finish it while mobs surround you. I have actual, clinical OCD,
so leaving it unfinished isn't an option for me. That means jumping in, mining,
and desperately trying to find a way out. Like I said, you're in a massive
cavern, so you can't climb up the walls with a bucket of water anymore. You
can leave a stream of water running from the top of the quarry, but that'll
make it hard to mine. Like I said, I don't usually need to do this, since I'm
automating even more of my resource collection, but it's such a pain when I do.</p>

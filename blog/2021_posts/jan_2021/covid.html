        <h2>
            My Experience With Mask Laws, as Somebody Who Can't Wear a Mask
        </h2>

        <p>
            In a world where face masks are now the standard and failing to wear one can put you on the bad side of the law and society, I am literally incapable of wearing one and have a recognized medical exemption. I did try, just in case I could, but I had to take it off in about a single minute. It sucks, but I truly can't abide by the face mask laws. Some people would be ecstatic about having the chance to get out of wearing a mask (and I've heard of people trying to pretend to have a disability to get out of wearing a mask), but it's really not all that it's cracked up to be.

            The first problem is how hard it is to find out if you're even exempt. This obviously differs depending on where you live, but it's actually pretty hard to find out if you qualify for an exemption here. There's no formal system set in place where you can go to the doctor and get an official exemption. It's all on an honour code. The government trusts you to not lie about having an exemption and every business and government building legally has to take you at your word when they ask you to wear a mask. There isn't even a list of conditions that make you exempt, which makes sense since you don't want to accidently exclude somebody who needs to be exempted, but it makes it a little hard to tell if you actually qualify when the guidelines are so vague. I ended up having to read some obscure law from over a decade ago that states that I'm exempt, as well as people who's disability has no affect on their ability on wearing a mask, like diabetics. Again, very unhelpful. At the end of the day, I can't wear a mask because of an medical condition, so I labelled myself exempt. I don't think a reasonable person would say that this is abusing the system, which probably makes me an exception to the rule.

            Speaking of abused, people really hate anti-maskers. I get why, but where does that leave people like me, who have no choice but to go maskless when we have to step outside? Just looking at me, you can't tell that I can't wear a mask. As far as everybody around me is concerned, I'm just an inconsiderate douche who wants to spread disease everywhere. I've heard that there are cases where people who can't wear a mask were attacked because of this. I thankfully haven't had to deal with any real discrimination, but you can always tell that people are looking at you funny. I can honestly say that we're one of the more hated groups in the world right now, and will be for at least a little bit longer. Everywhere you look, there's constant vitrol directed towards people who don't wear masks for not contributing to the greater good. Again, I get why people would be angry about that, but I literally can't help it. It's when I see people get angry at people like me, who they know are exempt, just for existing that I get worried. We're in a very unusual situation, but discrimination is never okay.

        I think the biggest thing for me right now is the sense of not 
        belonging. It sounds weird, but it feels like everybody has some 
        shared experience that I'm not a part of. I'll admit, I was kind 
        of glad that I didn't have to wear a mask at first once the 
        mandates were made. Not having to wear a mask helped to keep the 
        pandemic psychologically distant for me. I consider the face 
        mask to be the ultimate reminder of the temporary normal we find 
        ourselves in, and not having to wear a mask helped to remind me 
        that no matter how much the world was changing, it was only for 
        a bit. Now, it makes me feel like something of a permanent 
        outsider, like everybody else is in this big fight while I'm on 
        the sidelines. I can't wait until this is all over and I don't 
        have to feel like an outsider anymore.

            As you can probably tell, my name is Matteo Raso. I'm a 22 year old
            student at the University of Guelph. I'm currently finishing up my
            degree in Mathematical Sciences. I'm more than a little obsessed with
            free software (free as in freedom, not free as in free beer) and I'm
            trying to learn how to speak Japanese. Even though my degree is in
            mathematics, I ultimately want to be a programmer, or at least in
            a career that has me deal with code a lot.

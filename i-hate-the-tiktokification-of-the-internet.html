</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I think Tiktok was one of the worst things to happen to the internet.
Social media and the like have always been bad for you, but short form
content like literally everything found on Tiktok is like cyanide for
your attention span. I refuse to use the app, but it's hard to avoid
the problems of Tiktok when the internet is being consumed by Tiktok.
This isn't Tiktok's fault, they're just running their own app, but 
it's hard to ignore how the content that originates on Tiktok spreads.
Just about every video-sharing website (including websites you don't
normally think of as video-sharing websites, like Reddit and Facebook)
has been flooded with mirrors of Tiktok videos. These videos tend to
be the ones that blow up the most, because short-form content is the
most addictive, creating a feedback loop where people only look for
videos that match Tiktok's short-form style. Youtube is awful for this,
since it shoves Youtube Shorts down your throat. I try to block them,
but Youtube won't let you, since they know these videos are the ones
that keep you glued to the website. I know some people have the
self-control to avoid clicking on any of them, but I don't. I know that
there needs to be personal responsibility and all that, but you
can't tell people to exercise personal responsibility when websites
literally go out of their way to make it difficult for you to block
addictive content. I might just cut Youtube out of my life, honestly.
I've already deleted accounts for a lot of social media sites, and
while it can be pretty boring without a dripfeed of content at all
hours, I don't think a more boring life is a worse one.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>After uploading <a href="https://matteoraso.github.io/do-laptops-even-die-or-why-you-shouldnt-throw-out-your-laptop.html#do-laptops-even-die-or-why-you-shouldnt-throw-out-your-laptop">yesterday's post</a>, I learned that laptops aren't repairable anymore because they're so thin nowadays. To make them that thin, laptop manufacturers customize the hardware components, making it impossible to change or upgrade. I noticed that SATA hard drives aren't used anymore in laptops, which means that I can't just get a cheap drive and put it in my laptop, which is my main way of saving money when I buy a computer. Not only that, but you can't get a good cooling system in a thin laptop, because size = power for fans. If you didn't read my post yesterday, the only reason I'm even looking for a new laptop is because my current laptop's cooling system is dying. Why are laptop manufacturers screwing over their customers like this? Is there some huge demand for thin laptops that I don't know about? I know that the average consumer doesn't look too closely at the way that their laptop was built, but I'm sure that they would rather have a good laptop than a thin one, if they were forced to pick. At this point, I think I'm going to start advising people to only use their old laptops for as long as possible.</p>

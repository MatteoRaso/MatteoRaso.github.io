</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>A couple of years ago, I added a recovery phone number to my gmail 
so that I could get into my account if I ever forgot my password.
Fast forward to the present day, and I need to get back into the 
account. Even though I have my password after all these years, I
couldn't get in without a verification code sent to my old phone
number, which I no longer had. I was able to get my account back
by contacting my old phone number, but that was pure luck. I don't
know why somebody would come up with such a horrible anti-pattern,
but don't do this if you're in charge of a website and you want to
give your user an option to add a recovery phone number. Seriously,
there's no reason to think that somebody coming back to an account
after a few years is suspicious, unless you have a good reason to
think that your company was hacked. Pro-tip, you can keep your users's
passwords from getting cracked if you enforce a reasonable password
policy. That way, you can keep your users safe without locking them
out of their account. I'll never get how Google doesn't understand this.</p>

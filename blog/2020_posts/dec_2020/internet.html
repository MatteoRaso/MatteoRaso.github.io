            The Old Internet Was Better
        </h2>

            I am part of the last generation of people that knew what the internet was like before 2007. It's a bit odd to be nostalgic for anything really when you're in your early 20s, but I am. The internet felt so much different back then. Internet was something to you used either for emails or for looking at one of the countless websites. It wasn't like now, where there are behemoth social media websites that take up most of the internet traffic. The only real social media website we had was MySpace, and it wasn't nearly as ubiquidous as Facebook or Twitter is today. You would often go and see weird websites, in that old pre-Web 2.0 style. Sure, most of those websites were total garbage, but some of them were great.
            I think the biggest thing as that it wasn't so sanitized. Before you had all these corporations trying to use the internet for business, the internet was like the Wild, Wild West. It used to be that you had to be a little on edge when you opened up a Youtube video, because it may have very well had a screamer hidden inside. Yeah, it was kind of traumatic, but that's the way the internet was back then. The danger made things just a little bit more exciting. Now, everything has to go through some big corporation who cares more about their image and getting those advertising dollars instead of providing a fun experience. Come to think about it, people don't really have fun on the internet anymore. Now, it's all about politics, even the memes. I remember a time where people didn't talk about politics on the internet at all, because the internet was something that was seperate from the real world. Then again, you did have Occupy Wall Street and Project Chanology, so it's not like the internet was completely devoid of politics back then. Maybe the internet back then wasn't that different from the internet now. Who knows.

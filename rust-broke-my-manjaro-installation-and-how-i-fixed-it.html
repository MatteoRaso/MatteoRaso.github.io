    <p>You ever have a bad day and think to yourself "I really just want to play old Flash games right now?" I did last night, so I attempted to install a CLI Flash emulator called Ruffle. This is built on top of Rust, so I had to install that as well. Unfortunately, I was having trouble with Rust not finding a file called "cargo.toml", so I uninstalled Rust. When I went to boot up my laptop today, I found that my computer was getting stuck at the login GUI. I could enter the password, but when it would go to log me in, it froze for a second and brought me back to the GUI. After doing some digging in the TTY, I discovered that this was happening because bash was looking for .cargo/env, which no longer existed. Reinstalling Rust didn't help either, so I fixed the bug by manually creating a ".cargo" directory and adding an env file. Bash executes whatever's written in this file every time you open a terminal, so I just wrote "sleep 0". I know that there's probably a better way to do this, but my internet's out right now and I don't feel like spending time fighting with my computer over something I've already jerryrigged a solution for.</p>

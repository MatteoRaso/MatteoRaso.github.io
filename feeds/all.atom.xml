A big reason why people hate it so much is because they don't understand the main game mechanic, which is scarcity. The game is intentionally designed to make it so that you're constantly having to budget your cash and fight for houses and hotels, which are limited. Because people don't understand that, they invent house rules to inject more cash and houses into the game, like having a pool of money in the middle that goes to whoever lands on "Free Parking". This makes the game run for hours, because these house rules intentionally make it hard to go bankrupt. If you're playing Monopoly like that, it's not a surprise that the game is miserable. If played properly, however, it's only 1 hour, which is just enough time to not get bored of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>I Made Heston Blumenthal's Chicken</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/i-made-heston-blumenthals-chicken.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-11-26:/i-made-heston-blumenthals-chicken.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen a recipe that looked so wild and out there, you can't help but feel like you need to try it at least once in your life?

That's how I felt when I saw Heston's recipe for crispy roast chicken. You start off by brining the chicken in an 8% salt solution for 6 hours, soaking the chicken in clean water for 1 hour to remove the excess salt, removing the wing tips, boiling the chicken for 30 seconds to tighten the skin, plunging the chicken in ice water to stop the cooking process, boiling the chicken for 30 seconds again, plunging in the ice water again, leaving it to dry out overnight in the fridge, roasting at 140F (60C) for a couple of hours, searing with a pan fry, browning a large dollop of butter with the wing tips to create chicken-flavoured brown butter, and injecting the chicken with the butter. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kq8k7yTr8Y"&gt;No, I'm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-AUlvRSEBA"&gt;not joking&lt;/a&gt;. I did make a few modifications to the recipe to suit my own needs. First of all, I roasted the chicken on the stovetop using Adam Ragusea's trick to cook the legs without overcooking the breasts. Second, I broiled the chicken on top of searing the breasts with a pan fry to crisp the skin. Third, I had to put the chicken in at 170F because that's how low my oven goes. Finally, I skipped the butter injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience was kind of meh. For starters, either I was using a bad chicken or Heston neglected to mention how tearable the chicken's skin becomes after blanching. I accidently ripped a large part of the breast skin while pulling it out of the boiling water, and I noticed that the skin around the leg joint was also ripping just from its own weight. In hindsight, I should have left the chicken tied up until it was time to serve. Another thing is that Heston really understated how hard it is to sear the chicken. Letting your chicken go low and slow is great if you love &lt;a href="https://matteoraso.github.io/why-i-undercook-my-poultry.html"&gt;to undercook your chicken&lt;/a&gt;, but it does absolutely nothing for the skin. I knew that would be the case, but I didn't realize how hard it would be to compensate for. Heston said that deepfrying the chicken would be a step too far, but I think that it would be a great if you happen to already be deepfrying a side. If you have a convection oven, hanging the chicken and blasting the chicken at the highest temperature will do wonders. A rotisserie would also be good, but most people don't have one. A much more serious thing that Heston didn't mention is that the low and slow approach keeps the chicken in the danger zone for a long time. Despite cooking the chicken very thoroughly, there is some risk involved in this. I consider the risk to be small for me, but this shouldn't be given to the elderly or the immunocompromised. (&lt;a href="https://www.food-safety.com/articles/4722-the-danger-zone-reevaluated"&gt;A more detailed chart for the danger zone&lt;/a&gt; suggests that this cooking method isn't actually dangerous at all, but I don't know enough about food safety to tell if this is sound. This isn't a mainstream view among food safety experts, so make of that what you will). Something that's my fault, and something you have to be very careful to avoid, is not leaving the chicken to dry for long enough. I only left the chicken in the fridge for a couple hours, but you really want to leave it for half a day, maybe even a full one. The dry skin is what makes the chicken crispy, and like I said, you're already facing an uphill battle on that front. When I did this recipe, I actually ended up with a chicken that was less crispy than when I do it normally. Really, no point in trying to rush a recipe that requires over 10 hours no matter what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if it was because of the brine, but I found the chicken slightly tough. I wouldn't call it bad at all, but the breasts weren't as tender as I'm used to. Having meat that's salted all the way through is nice, though. The wings were ridiculously tender. It would be extreme to make this recipe just for the wings, but if you like wings, definitely factor that into your decision about whether or not to make this. The meat was evenly cooked all the way through, which wasn't a big thing for me, but I could understand how that would be major for other people. The browned butter wasn't my thing. I never make brown butter, so the nutty notes threw me off. That's obviously something that depends on the person, though, and it's not like you  have to make the butter if you don't want to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the major takeaway that should be had from this recipe is that the quality of the meat matters. I was just using a normal supermarket bird, which was raised to be cheap protein for a normal meal. A recipe this refined is really best used on a heritage chicken, or at least a farm chicken that's packed with flavour. I don't regret making this recipe with a normal chicken, and I honestly might do it again to see if I can get that crispy skin I crave so much, but this isn't the kind of thing that you would have the energy to do on a regular basis. If you're making a special occasion chicken dinner, it only makes sense to have a top-quality chicken. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Food"></category></entry><entry><title>What Is Going On With Youtube Ads?</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/what-is-going-on-with-youtube-ads.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-10-31:/what-is-going-on-with-youtube-ads.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've recently found myself watching a lot of Youtube videos on my flip phone because I have no audio on my new desktop (thanks, Linux).

This means getting hit with ads designed to be seen by people with no viewer history, since my phone doesn't have enough RAM for cookies. I've found that Youtube ads can be split into 3 main groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shilling. There's a bunch of long ads designed to sell you dropshipping courses and other get-rich-quick schemes. There's nothing really interesting to say about them, but they're everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outright scams. Now that audio deepfakes are a thing, I sometimes get ads that use AI generated clips of Elon Musk saying that he developed a program that trades crypto for easy profit. These scams scare me. I'm savvy enough to know that any voice I hear online can be faked, but a lot of people don't. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOLWTF? These are the interesting ones. There's a singer in my city that makes these songs about being happy that I find really cultish, and he put out a massive ad campaign to have them played to just about every single person in my city. That means I'm constantly getting these full songs I hate from some random dude. I've also gotten a few blindness denial ads, which is the main reason I decided to make this blog post. It's so weird, it's this mineral that's supposed to fix your vision by treating some sort of neurological problem. This ad is extremely insistent that bad eyesight is because your brain can't process information, not because your eyes actually suck. It also negs you into buying the mineral by saying that your family will start to think that you can't take care of yourself if your eyesight gets worse. Really awful, bizarre stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youtube is trying to stop adblockers to make more money, but the flipside of this is that they let anybody take out whatever kind of ad they want. If they really want to make us watch ads, there needs to be a filter to keep out the trash ads, which seems to be most of them at this point.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Something I'm Doing With ChatGPT</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/something-im-doing-with-chatgpt.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-09-20:/something-im-doing-with-chatgpt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I literally just finished playing around with ChatGPT, and I found that it's really good at making stories, especially in other languages.

It clicked to me that the reason is because western culture isn't really that formal. Maybe that sounds obvious to some people, but as somebody who's been exclusively raised in western culture, it actually came as a bit of a shock. Fashion is pretty much the only place in western culture where there's a big focus on adhering to strict social protocols, but because formal clothing is worn based on how formal an event is, these social protocols literally don't matter at all. No matter how formal an event is, you're probably going to be wearing a suit and tie, which is actually considered casual. There's a few circumstances where you're expected to wear a tuxedo (which is considered semi-formal), but there's very few people that will ever be invited to a white-tie event, which is full formal. This is all a carryover from a time where western society cared about formality. I honestly think it's good that we don't focus so much on formality anymore, but I think it's cool that we can see how society has evolved through small details and understand things about our culture that we normally take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I Undercook My Poultry</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/why-i-undercook-my-poultry.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-08-14:/why-i-undercook-my-poultry.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The title is partially clickbait: I only undercook the white meat.

Because dark meat is full of fat and connective tissue, it needs to be very well cooked to get a nice texture. White meat doesn't have that, so it's very prone to drying out if you overcook it. I'm sure everybody knows what it's like to eat a chicken breast that's dry and stringy, which is just an awful experience. The problem is that people get very scared around chicken, so they cook it for a ridiculous amount of time instead of using a meat thermometer to make sure the chicken reached a safe temperature. Officially, the safe internal temperature for chicken is 165 F, which is what most recipes tell you to aim for. The problem is that even this is slightly overcooking the chicken, leading to a meal that's not bad but kind of just meh. Believe it or not, this is by design. The government's goal is to find a foolproof temperature to recommend to people, not to help people actually make tasty chicken. That means they can and do recommend cooking temperatures that are higher than required to make sure nobody messes up, at the cost of us actually enjoying dinner. Also, unless you're cooking your chicken with sous vide, the outside of your chicken will be hotter than the inside, so the chicken will be hotter than the recommended internal temperature when you actually eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to studies posted by the &lt;a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/smprv/uploads/files/RTE_Poultry_Tables1.pdf"&gt;Food Safety And Inspection Service of USDA&lt;/a&gt;, poultry instantly achieves a 7-log10 relative reduction in Salmonella for all levels of fat when the meat reaches an internal temperature of 163 F. Since chicken breasts are lean, you can get an instant 7-log10 relative reduction with 162 F. The thing is, why do you want an instant reduction? Cooking to a lower temperature and maintaining it gives you the exact same safety without compromising on quality. Is it really a big deal to pull your chicken out at 160 F (a full 5 degrees below the recommended amount of time) and wait 17 seconds at the absolute most? What about at 155 F and waiting a single minute? Unless you eat your meat straight out of the oven, you're probably already waiting that long. Besides, you're supposed to rest your meat for at least 10 minutes to let the juices redistribute. Like I said before, the outside of the chicken is hotter than the inside, so the internal temperature won't drop while it rests on your counter. You can easily "undercook" your poultry by a full 20 degrees as long as you patiently rest your meat (although if you try this with a smaller chicken, you should tent the meat to keep it from cooling off too fast and constantly check the temperature to make sure it doesn't fall until you know the meat is safe). For literally 0 risk, I get chicken breasts that are so juicy and tender, you'd almost want to cry thinking about all the dry and stringy chicken breasts you used to be content with.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Food"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Blockbuster Was Right To Not Buy Netflix</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/why-blockbuster-was-right-to-not-buy-netflix.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-08-13:/why-blockbuster-was-right-to-not-buy-netflix.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, you see people talk about how Blockbuster not buying Netflix was one of the worst financial decisions in history.

That's arguable, but what people are usually trying to say is that Blockbuster made a &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; decision, and anybody with a brain would have taken the deal. I want to push back on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal in question was an offer to buy Netflix for $50,000,000 back in 2000. It's been quite a while, but I'm sure most people who were alive back then have some vague memory of dialup internet. If you don't, the key takeaway is that it was slow, very slow. You weren't watching any shows you got online unless you spent literal hours downloading it. Streaming requires downloading footage at least as fast as you watch it, so that wasn't an option at all. Even though it's now known for streaming, the business model for Netflix at the time was to mail out DVDs that were ordered on the internet. When the customer was done with them, they mailed the DVDs back. It worked well, but it wasn't the revolutionary change that made Netflix into a billion dollar company. At the time that the offer was made, the economy was in a recession because the dot-com bubble burst and countless promising internet startups were going under. From the perspective of Blockbuster, you have an internet startup with an easily replicated business model that had a massive chance of going under in a year offering to let you buy them so they won't become a competitor in case they survive. Even though they were wrong, it made perfect sense to think that Netflix wouldn't become an issue for them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anybody who was alive at the time can tell you, Blockbuster didn't quickly die after passing up that deal. Shortly after this happened, Blockbuster entered the online DVD rental business themselves, even becoming a serious competitor to Netflix. They also started to offer streaming services in 2007 as soon as the technology was ready, just like Netflix. The reason why people don't mention this, I think, is because streaming was still rare back in 2007 and because Blockbuster was already starting to lose its popularity before streaming even became a thing. Either way, it's not like Blockbuster stubbornly sat still while Netflix (and nobody else) went ahead to pioneer movie streaming. If Blockbuster actually had purchased Netflix, there's a good chance that some other company would have beaten Blockbuster on streaming and killed the company themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real reason for why Blockbuster died isn't really clear. Some people say that it was bad leadership, other people say that it was because of excessive late fees, but I don't think anybody who wasn't there when it happened really knows. Personally, I think Netflix had fairly little to do with it. All I know is, the death of Blockbuster wasn't because of a small mistake that only seems dumb in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Board Game Engines Are About Trees, Not Evaluation Functions</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/board-game-engines-are-about-trees-not-evaluation-functions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-07-31:/board-game-engines-are-about-trees-not-evaluation-functions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been flirting with the idea of making a game engine to evaluate Brazilian Draughts, which I plan to do with alpha-beta pruning.

Since I might be spending a bit of time working on tree searches, I want to write about something that I've noticed for a while: whenever people talk about game engines for perfect information board games, they only focus on the evaluation function, which makes it seem like the evaluation function is the most important part. AlphaZero is a good example of this, since most articles focused on the neural network while completely ignoring how it worked with the Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is the important part. In this article, I want to explain why the evaluation function isn't as important as the tree search and why you might even want to weaken your evaluation function sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a perfect information board game, the optimal algorithm is a brute-force search of the entire game tree. This perfectly solves every single position, but it requires too much time and memory to actually be practical for anything but the smallest games. That means that we have to make an approximation for our brute-force tree search, which we do by creating an evaluation function. That's why focusing too much on the evaluation function is misguided: it's just there to help approximate the exhaustive tree search, not actually tell you what your next move should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When somebody tries to create a game engine without remembering that they should be focusing on the tree search, they sometimes end up over-engineering the evaluation function to be as strong as possible, at the cost of making the evaluation function very expensive to call. Since the evaluation function isn't there to tell you what the best move is, this focus on power over cost can actually make your engine weaker. You obviously don't want to make your evaluation function be bad, but if you increase the cost of calling your evaluation function, you might end up not being able to search enough of the game tree. You can get around that by using a tree search that doesn't require the evaluation to be called many times, like Monte Carlo Tree Search, but you still need to stay focused on the tree search instead of the evaluation function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of looking at this is that the further into the game tree you can look, the cheaper you can make your evaluation function. In a brute-force search, you just have to check if a position is won, lost, or drawn after the game has ended. The more shallow your search is, the more the evaluation function has to do to compensate for the lack of depth. The catch is that positions are more complicated the earlier into the game you are. That's because every piece (or empty space on the board, if you're playing Go or Tic-Tac-Toe) is a degree of freedom, and the number of pieces (or empty spaces) is highest at the beginning of the game. That means your evaluation function will have to become exponentially more powerful the more shallow your search is, which means the cost of your evaluation function will exponentially increase, unless you can figure out how to solve the game mathematically. Going to extremes and trying to completely replace the tree search with an evaluation function gives you the same problem of requiring too much time and memory like the brute-force approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temptation here (and the reason why I'm writing this article for me just as much as for everybody else) is that there's a lot of ways to make strong but expensive evaluation functions. If you have the resources, it wouldn't be difficult to feed millions of sample games to a big neural network and use that as the evaluation function, but that would only worsen your engine unless you use a tree search that's designed for expensive evaluation functions. These resources would be much better spent optimizing the tree search by creating endgame tablebases and transposition tables, which reduce the number of lines that need to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technology"></category></entry><entry><title>Recap Of The Reddit Blackout</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/recap-of-the-reddit-blackout.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-07-24:/recap-of-the-reddit-blackout.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The blackout seemed to have taken the internet by storm, but not much has been heard about it since.

&lt;h1&gt;Why The Blackout Happened&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The blackout seemed to have taken the internet by storm, but not much has been heard about it since. Now that things seem to have mostly been resolved, I want to give an overview of what happened and my thoughts about it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why The Blackout Happened&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don't remember or didn't hear about it when it was happening, the Reddit blackout was a mass protest over Reddit's API changes. Previously, access to the API was free, which allowed 3rd party developers to use it to create bots and their own apps for Reddit. However, the CEO of Reddit announced that anybody using more than 100 API calls a minute would have to pay $0.24 for every 1000 API calls. This meant that a very popular 3rd party iOS app for Reddit called Apollo would have to pay $20,000,000 a year. Obviously, not exactly spare change. The developer announced that he would shut down the app on June 30th, which prompted a massive backlash against Reddit. The mods for most of the largest subreddits decided to take all their subreddits and make them private for 2 days, effectively shutting down the entire website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why Do People Care This Much About An App?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Reddit got a redesign that proved to be very unpopular. Not only did the redesign replace the classic UI that Reddit had from the start, the redesign was a lot more resource-intensive than the older UI. This made for a website that was a lot less responsive and downright inaccessible for people with old hardware or bad internet. The redesign was widely considered ugly and filled with antipatterns, prompting many users to avoid it as much as possible. To put it in the words of /u/all_copacetic, &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/NJ3cr"&gt;"Words can't describe how much I hate new reddit. I was actually deeply saddened by the thought  that I'd never be able to experience old reddit again. As if a friend had died. I hope to fuck they never remove the option of opting out of the ugly, slow new design."&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, while it's still possible to use the old UI, it occasionally forces you into the new UI, which makes it annoying to use. At the same time, part of the new redesign was constant notifications asking you to use the offical app, which many users considered to be annoying and an antipattern. This could be prevented with 3rd party apps, but the API change was going to ruin all that, and many users felt that the API change was designed solely for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why That Isn't Why People Cared&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous section wasn't wrong, but it lacks context. Most people didn't use 3rd party apps, especially Apollo, which is only available on iPhones anyways. A lot of the backlash boiled down to an aversion to what is seen as corporate greed, Reddit's classic love of using the website for mass protest movements, and just because the users with the most power on the website were dragging everybody along with them. The last reason is an important one. Reddit relies on volunteer users to moderate the subreddits, which gives a minority of users a lot of power over how the website is run. Even if people disagree with what the mods do, they don't really have a choice but to go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why Reddit Wasn't Entirely Wrong&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API change came way too fast, but charging for API access isn't unreasonable. These changes only affect heavy users, and apps designed for accessibility will be exempt. If I was a CEO of a massive company, I wouldn't want people to make money by using my infrastructure without paying anything back, either. The pricing is definitely too high, but not enough to completely kill the apps. All you would need to do is kill the free-tier for your app, reduce the number of API calls as much as you can, and you'd still be able to profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why The Mods Were Very Wrong&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of people pointed out, a 2 day strike is nothing. Some of the mods understood that and decided to go on strike indefinitely, but a lot of them reopened their subreddits as planned. This completely killed the strike, but that's not what I find interesting about all of this. Apparently, a lot of the mods ultimately decided to reopen their subreddits because &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/reddit-ceo-threatens-to-boot-moderators-who-back-blackout-protest"&gt;the CEO threatened to take away their mod rights.&lt;/a&gt; That's right: they reopened their subreddits because the Reddit CEO threatened to take away their unpaid job. Wow, such a scary situation to find yourself in /s. Another weird thing that the mods did was coming up with alternative means of protesting, like spamming &lt;a href="https://uproxx.com/viral/john-oliver-reddit-protest/"&gt;pictures of John Oliver.&lt;/a&gt; I don't know what the plan was there, but Reddit corporate doesn't care that you've posted a picture of John Oliver. What they do care about is increasing the number of people that post on Reddit, so you're literally just rewarding them. All in all, this strike reflected very poorly on the mods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Twitter Situation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I started to come up with this post, &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/twitter/twitter-crisis-explained-what-are-rate-limits-and-when-will-they-end"&gt;Twitter began to rate-limit itself,&lt;/a&gt; causing a massive drop in usage. As I began to write this paragraph, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/24/elon-musk-rebrands-twitter-to-x-replaces-iconic-bird-logo.html"&gt;Twitter killed its iconic brand.&lt;/a&gt; Now that Meta has created Threads to be ~~Twitter's~~ X's first major competitor, it's clear that ~~Twitter~~ X will never be the powerhouse it once was, if it even survives the next couple of years. It's just a coincidence that this happened at the same time as the Reddit fiasco, but it does show that social media is changing massively all at once. Nobody really knows what the future holds for social media, but it certainly feels like we're moving even further away from the era where social media was about the users. Hopefully this leads users to move away for greener pastures, because a website designed to extract as much value out of you at all costs isn't a website worth using.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Fire</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/fire.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-06-26:/fire.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I went on the shortest walk I've been on in months.

If that's the case, why has mobile gaming been so awful? I know nostalgia is
a huge factor for why I look so fondly at the GBA, but mobile gaming being
an absolute garbage fire is a very common opinion, and with good reason.
Most mobile games (at least the successful ones) are more focused on increasing
metrics like retention and downloads instead of actually being fun, with
profits coming from actively ruining the player experience by shoving ads
down your throats or literally making you addicted through in-game gambling.
It's such a shame that an avenue for gaming that's over 1000 times as strong
as the GBA is being put to waste like this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Video Games"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Does Mr Beast Do This?</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/why-does-mr-beast-do-this.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-06-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-06-11:/why-does-mr-beast-do-this.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I was watching yesterday's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48h57PspBec"&gt;MrBeast video&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed that the picture from Chris's coming out tweet was taken while filming for the $1,000,000 yacht.

If that sounds like Checkers, that's because Checkers is just an
American/English form of Draughts. Draughts tends to be misjudged
as Chess for people who aren't smart enough for Chess, but that
assumes that Draughts is supposed to be like Chess in the first place.
In reality, they're different games with different strategies.
Chess requires you to look at a broad array of potential moves,
while Draughts requires you to look deeply into the possible lines
that are available. The main feature of Draughts games is the way
you're forced to make captures. While you're sometimes forced to make
moves in Chess, Draughts will routinely have you finding yourself 
in a position where you're helplessly forced to make bad move after
bad move while a more skilled player prepares a devastating attack
that'll destroy your position.

Social media and the like have always been bad for you, but short form
content like literally everything found on Tiktok is like cyanide for
your attention span. I refuse to use the app, but it's hard to avoid
the problems of Tiktok when the internet is being consumed by Tiktok.
This isn't Tiktok's fault, they're just running their own app, but 
it's hard to ignore how the content that originates on Tiktok spreads.
Just about every video-sharing website (including websites you don't
normally think of as video-sharing websites, like Reddit and Facebook)
has been flooded with mirrors of Tiktok videos. These videos tend to
be the ones that blow up the most, because short-form content is the
most addictive, creating a feedback loop where people only look for
videos that match Tiktok's short-form style. Youtube is awful for this,
since it shoves Youtube Shorts down your throat. I try to block them,
but Youtube won't let you, since they know these videos are the ones
that keep you glued to the website. I know some people have the
self-control to avoid clicking on any of them, but I don't. I know that
there needs to be personal responsibility and all that, but you
can't tell people to exercise personal responsibility when websites
literally go out of their way to make it difficult for you to block
addictive content. I might just cut Youtube out of my life, honestly.
I've already deleted accounts for a lot of social media sites, and
while it can be pretty boring without a dripfeed of content at all
hours, I don't think a more boring life is a worse one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category></entry><entry><title>I Don't Believe AGI Will Happen</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/i-dont-believe-agi-will-happen.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-05-18:/i-dont-believe-agi-will-happen.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;With all the hype (and fear) about ChatGPT and existential threats caused

a problem, an intelligent agent has to actually decide that the equation
can be used to solve the problem and then use a computer to do the
calculations. I think that autonomy is an essential aspect of intelligence,
which an equation will never emulate, much less have. I don't want to say
that AI doesn't have the potential to be dangerous, especially in the hands

was. It's genuinely breathtaking to see the new overworld terrain generation
while exploring my world. Sadly, I've found myself in a situation where I
have to be reminded that the cliff update was paired with a cave update.
I can understand why people (maybe even most people) would like the cave
update, but it's caused me nothing but grief. I have a horrible sense of
direction, so bad that I struggled to navigate caves with the old world
generation. Now that caves are massive, trying to not get lost is pointless.
Instead, I minimize the amount of mining that I need to do by using automatic
farms that get me the things that I need. Still, I do sometimes have to go
mining, so I dig quarries. This was hard enough back in the good old days,
but at least you would only have to deal with fairly small pockets of space
beneath your feet. Now, you have to deal with a massive cavern that you're
going to drop into. When you've dug up all the upper part of the quarry, you
either have to leave the quarry unfinished, or you have to jump into the
cavern and finish it while mobs surround you. I have actual, clinical OCD,
so leaving it unfinished isn't an option for me. That means jumping in, mining,
and desperately trying to find a way out. Like I said, you're in a massive
cavern, so you can't climb up the walls with a bucket of water anymore. You
can leave a stream of water running from the top of the quarry, but that'll
make it hard to mine. Like I said, I don't usually need to do this, since I'm
automating even more of my resource collection, but it's such a pain when I do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Video Games"></category></entry><entry><title>Facade Was Underrated</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/facade-was-underrated.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-15T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-05-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-05-15:/facade-was-underrated.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it was definitely janky, but it's incredible that the devs were

Every time that I do, I always come back to the feeling that I don't really have to do this. If you look online, the conventional wisdom is that the average lifespan of a laptop is 3-5 years. My laptop is 4 years old, so about the time you would expect for it to die, if you follow the conventional wisdom. The thing is, I don't. My hot take is that even a cheap laptop should last you 10 years if you maintain the hardware components well. From what I can tell, when people say that their laptop is dead, they don't actually mean that it died, they just mean that it's slow. The few articles that explained why laptops only last 3-5 years follow the same line of thought, saying that laptops have to be replaced after that amount of time because the hardware wouldn't be able to keep up with Windows updates. Well, I use Linux, so that's not a problem for me. The main reason why my laptop is dying is that the fans are failing, which threatens to make my already hot computer have uncontrollable thermals eventually. With the way my fans sound, that might happen in a month, but my laptop might stabilize and crawl along for up to a year. Again, still within the 3-5 year estimated lifespan, but not for the reasons that are usually given. Also, it ignores the circumstances behind my laptop failing. I'll admit it, I did not take good care of this thing. I knew that this laptop had bad thermals, but I never even attempted to change the thermal paste until after my computer was no longer able to keep the CPU temperature below 95 C, which it was idling at for years. I'm not talking about normal years, I'm talking about culmative years of usage. I play a lot of games that benefit from AFKing, so I would just leave my laptop running over night, every night, for about 2 years, never dipping below 95 C. All in all, I'd say that my laptop's fans have done about a decade's worth of work in the past 4 years. While I couldn't replace the thermal paste because the screws holding my fan down have seized, I was able to get the heat down by cleaning up the dust that built up inside, removing the battery (which was generating a ton of heat and could barely hold a charge anymore), and getting a cooling pad. I know that not being able to change the thermal paste will come back to bite me down the line, but at least I bought my laptop a month (and counting). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's why I've been a bit obsessed with laptop life expectancy for the past few weeks. Being able to buy at least another month from worn-out fans is impressive, and exactly what every tech article says that I shouldn't be able to do. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, because the tech articles aren't written for more advanced laptop users that want to extend their laptop lifespan as much as possible, they're written for a broad audience that wants the best user experience. I get it, but I don't like it. Replacing a laptop is expensive, contributes to e-waste, and probably means getting a laptop that's lower quality than your current one (looking over all the laptops I've seen online, I haven't seen a single good one). Compared to that, spending $50-70 on peripherals to keep my laptop running for a bit longer is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't even gotten into replacements for hardware components yet. While I would never even think about trying this, I've seen people with my exact same type of laptop add a water-cooling system to keep a temperatures down better than a fan ever could. A less extreme example would be replacing the hard drive or RAM as your needs evolve. That's how the used Thinkpad community stays thriving despite everybody there using a laptop that's over 10 years old, although a lot of them have replaced so many components, they ended up with a laptop of Theseus that may or may not be the original laptop. Whatever the case may be, it's clear that laptops are a lot more durable than people give them credit for, as long as you're willing to put in a bit of effort to keep them running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I plan on using a laptop that's already 10 years old as my daily driver once my current one is unusable. For some reason I don't understand, my mom has kept my sister's old laptop from 2012 hidden away for all these years, so I took it to use as a secondary laptop, not realizing how good it is. Like most laptops from that time period, it has a much better build quality than laptops made nowadays. On top of that, the specs are surprisingly good. A 1 TB hard drive, decent CPU, and only 4 GB of RAM, but an option to upgrade to 8 GB (don't buy the fear-mongering about needing 16 GB of RAM, 8 GB is plenty for most people). I've already played around with it, and it's nice and responsive. With a bit of maintenance, I expect that laptop to last me for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technology"></category></entry><entry><title>Rust Broke My Manjaro Installation (And How I Fixed It)</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/rust-broke-my-manjaro-installation-and-how-i-fixed-it.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-04-24:/rust-broke-my-manjaro-installation-and-how-i-fixed-it.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You ever have a bad day and think to yourself "I really just want to play old Flash games right now?"

I did last night, so I attempted to install a CLI Flash emulator called Ruffle. This is built on top of Rust, so I had to install that as well. Unfortunately, I was having trouble with Rust not finding a file called "cargo.toml", so I uninstalled Rust. When I went to boot up my laptop today, I found that my computer was getting stuck at the login GUI. I could enter the password, but when it would go to log me in, it froze for a second and brought me back to the GUI. After doing some digging in the TTY, I discovered that this was happening because bash was looking for .cargo/env, which no longer existed. Reinstalling Rust didn't help either, so I fixed the bug by manually creating a ".cargo" directory and adding an env file. Bash executes whatever's written in this file every time you open a terminal, so I just wrote "sleep 0". I know that there's probably a better way to do this, but my internet's out right now and I don't feel like spending time fighting with my computer over something I've already jerryrigged a solution for.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technology"></category></entry><entry><title>A Weird Image Compression Program</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/a-weird-image-compression-program.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-04-23:/a-weird-image-compression-program.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you're like me, you clogged up your entire hard drive with memes.

I decided that I needed to clean up my computer a bit, so instead of doing the sensible thing and delete as many memes as I could bear, I decided to code an image compression program to free up space without degrading quality too much. I came up with this convoluted plan to convert images into 3D fourier transforms, remove low-frequency waves, and then convert back into an image. That was a bust, but I did notice something interesting. When I converted an image into a 3D array and converted it back into an image, the size went down without me actually doing anything to the image. I don't know why that happens, but I suspect it's at least partially because any metadata that the picture has is erased. The degree of compression depends on the image, but I've gotten over &amp;gt;80% reduction of size with particularly large and detailed images. For all the jpgs in my main directory, the total size went from 224 MB to 130 MB after compressing, a nice &amp;gt;40% reduction. The only problem is that some images end up completely destroyed. I don't know what causes it, but it seems to have to do with images being almost completely black to begin with. Still, I'm very pleased with the results.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technology"></category></entry><entry><title>Look, I'm Just Going To Say It</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/look-im-just-going-to-say-it.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-04-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-04-20:/look-im-just-going-to-say-it.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Neon Genesis Evangelion" was mid.

I enjoyed it, and I certainly didn't regret watching it, but it's not the groundbreaking anime that everybody seems to think that it is. It's just a normal mecha with slightly deep themes. The plot was convoluted and a lot of questions get left unanswered, which gives a lot of room for fan discussion but ultimately just made it a pain to watch at times. The ending was actually fantastic and redeemed the entire show for me, but then the studio decided to undermine that with a series of movies designed to please the fans that hated the ending. To be fair, I've heard that EoE was really good, but I've also heard a lot of bad things about Rebuild. I'll probably do a review of EoE one day, but that still doesn't change the fact that the original anime was underwhelming compared to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it's super creepy how the fanbase is obsessed with discussing which 14 year old is hotter.

&lt;p&gt;I was working on this game I've been programming for a while when I decided to add a little feature to let the player check how good the armor that they're wearing actually is. I commit, check the 'git status' to see if there was anything that I was missing, found nothing, and pushed to my Github repo. All in all, a pretty normal experience, until I noticed an extremely abnormal bug. Instead of pushing my code, Git said "fatal: unable to read 'messed_up_hash'". For some reason I still don't understand, Git expected the commit to be under a different hash than the one it was actually under. A bit unusual, so I look up solutions. I find several solutions to fix corrupted objects, but none of them worked for me, since they assume that the hash is actually there (I checked my .git directory, there really wasn't a hash there). This brought me to what looked like the only solution I hadn't tried: delete the repo, pull from Github, and accept losing your unpushed commits. This isn't exactly a bad solution, since it works and it's easy to do, but it assumes best practice. I have (or at least had, now that this scare has fixed me up) a habit where I let commits pile up before pushing. This is not best practice. I had 8 commits piled up, one of which was extremely important and took a considerable amount of time to figure out. Dumping it wasn't an option as far as I'm concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I decided to keep looking for solutions to my problem. Thankfully, I found one other person who had my exact same problem: Jim Schubert.  In a 2012 post on &lt;a href="https://www.ipreferjim.com/2012/02/git-push-fatal-unable-to-read-sha1/"&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt;, almost down to the exact same day that I had the problem, Jim outlines a way to fix the problem by writing the hash to Git. It's a reasonable fix, but with one problem: it didn't work on my repo. Again, no idea why, since there's no reason why it wouldn't work, but computers don't always act in logical ways. Yet again, I had to search for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, it hit me: why not just get rid of the commit? I use 'git reset' to remove it, only to find out that it needs the non-existent hash in order to remove it. Great. At this point, I'm trying to find out how to remove a commit without directly interacting with the commit when I finally find my solution: backup the problematic file, use 'git rm' to get rid of it, use your text editor of choice on the copy to undo whatever changes you made, rename the copy as the original file, use 'git add', and then run 'git commit --amend --allow-empty'. Your commit still stays, and will probably always stay, but now Git won't give you any problems about missing hashes. After running those commands, I was finally able to push to my Github repo. Here's hoping I never have to do this again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technology"></category></entry><entry><title>Free Software Isn't Free</title><link href="https://matteoraso.github.io/free-software-isnt-free.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-16T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-04-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Matteo Raso</name></author><id>tag:matteoraso.github.io,2023-04-16:/free-software-isnt-free.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Note: This article was originally written on December, 12, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title for this post sounds like a contradiction. How can something be free yet not free? That's because English is a little bit weird. Other languages (like Italian) don't have a word for free. Most romance languages have a word called (or derived from) "gratis", which refers to no price, and a word called (or dervived from) "libre", which means no restrictions. You've probably noticed that many free software have "libre" in their name. That's because the "free" in free software is about the freedom given to the user, not that the software is gratis. When I say "Free software isn't free", I mean that libre software isn't gratis and gratis software isn't free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are times when software is both libre and gratis. I'm not entirely sure I've ever seen libre software that wasn't also gratis, although I've seen many, many software that is gratis but not libre. I feel like this ambiguity has actually been one of the biggest barriers to widespread adoption of free software. I constantly see criticism of free software from people saying that you're the product when you use free software, people saying that free software advocates are just cheap, and even people saying that free software is communist. At the same time, programmers feel like it's not worth their time to program free software, because they think it's gratis and programmers obviously have to get paid if they want it to be a full-time job. Don't get me wrong, I love that I don't really have to pay for any of my software, but being gratis is just a secondary benefit of free software. If the Linux Foundation were to turn around tomorrow and say that they were going to charge people a fee to use any future version of the kernel (and they absolutely could under the GPL), I would probably pay for it. That's because what I ultimately want is software that respects my freedoms as a consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According the the Free Software Foundation, free software has to obey four freedoms: the user must be able to use it however they want, the user must be allowed to study the source code, the user must be allowed to redistribute the software, and the user must be able to modify the software. You don't even need to make the code open-source, since the GPL itself even says that it's okay to make the code available to customers on request only, so long as you don't charge more than the cost to send it to them. These aren't radical new freedoms, if you really think about it. Let's say you buy a record player (if they even still make those). Obviously, the company can't sell it to you if it doesn't work, and the customer can always use it in unconventional ways like using it as a really large paperweight or for benchpressing without restriction by the company, so it follows freedom 0. If the customer wants, they can always take the record player apart and see how it works inside, so we also have freedom 1. You can always give it away or sell it if you don't want it anymore without restriction, so the user also has freedom 2. Finally, the user can make a new piece for the record player in his very convienent blacksmithing forge and use it to modify the record player, so the user has freedom 4. The idea that a customer wouldn't be able to have all four of these freedoms is a pretty new idea, and one that I don't like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, software is different from a record player, since a record player requires a lot more effort to duplicate than software. However, people have had a long history of distributing intellectual property. Every library you go to is based on the belief that books can and should be available to everybody free of charge. In fact, libraries even profit off of books by charging fees if you don't return them in time. Now that we have ebooks, libraries even give away the books for the "borrower" to keep, free of charge. In many ways, librarians were the free software advocates before software was invented. Of course, people have been able to get software for free (gratis) for a long time now, thanks to torrenting. Still, the companies who made the software (or the song, game, movie, etc etc) still do just fine, because a significant amount of people still choose to buy the software out of ethical reasons. Removing restrictions on redistributing software shouldn't change this all that much. If somebody takes your software and improves it by such a significant amount that people buy their version instead of yours, then it's your fault for releasing an inferior product and you should release a new patch so your software is even better than the fork. That's just how the free market works, baby. Either way, the consumers come out on top from this, since the increased competion means that companies have no choice but to make their software even better instead of staying mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the biggest problem with non-libre software is that you're the product. Just look at Windows. Even though you pay for it (probably not directly, but it's bundled into the cost of your computer), it still gives you ads and comes pre-installed with awful games that paid off Microsoft. Not only that, they collect your data through telemetry to use for market research and then sell it to all sorts of companies who also want to use your data to study. You are paying to be a walking commodity for massive corporations who risk YOUR data being stolen or falling into the wrong hands so THEY can turn a profit. You can't do that with free software. If somebody tries to create software that shoves unskippable ads down your throat or steals your data, then somebody will modify the software to disable these features and distribute their version themselves. Maybe you disagree with me, and that's okay. All I know is is that my experience with computers have gotten much better since I've started to use free software.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Technology"></category></entry></feed>

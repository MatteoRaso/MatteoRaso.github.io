            I Hate Kanji so Much
        </h2>

        <h3>
           Japanese isn't like English, where you string together a bunch of letters to make a word. To start with, Japanese doesn't even really have an alphabet in the same way that English does.
           In Japanese, you have TWO alphabets: Hiragana and Katakana, each used in different circumstances. They're both 46 characters, which is large but not too difficult to memorize. The problem
           comes when you actually want to use these to write words. Katakana is never used to write Japanese words (but very common for foreign words), so you have to use Hiragana. Hiragana is nice,
           but it's a pain to write out entire words in it. That's why most words are written as one or more kanji, which comes from the Chinese manji. There are over 6000 of these kanji in use. Granted,
           you only need to learn the most common 1000 kanji to have a decent-ish understanding of Japanese, and memorizing the radicals that the kanji are composed of can make remembering how they're written
           easier, but it's still a lot.

        <h3>
            Remember how I said that kanji come from manji? They also adopted the Chinese pronouciations of the manji without abandoning the Japanese pronounciations. That's right, virtually every single kanji
            has multiple ways of being read, and you can only tell which one to use by context or (if you're lucky) accompanying Hiragana that tells you how to pronounce it. There aren't really any kanji with only
            one reading except for ones that were created by the Japanese after Kanji were adopted. Even then, sometimes it does have a Chinese pronounciation, even when there's no Chinese influence. Why? Who knows.
            Even Japanese people, as in native Japanese people who've been speaking the language their entire life, can't memorize anywhere close to every reading. That's why you sometimes see anime characters
            introduce themselves by saying how their name is spelt and how it's pronounced, since it's impossible to sound it out. The Kanji Kentei, a test for Japanese people to test their Kanji knowledge, has
            10 levels. Passing level 2 is considered resume-worthy. Passing level 1 requires you to take an incredibly hard pre-level 1 test just to take it. Of the 2000 people who take it every year, some of the
            most well-educated people in Japan, only 20% pass. I get it, most native English speakers can't recognize anywhere close to 100% of all English words, but we also don't have a resume-building test that
            incentivizes people to learn as many words as possible. I'll be the first to admit that English has some very weird quirks (like the "i before e" rule that doesn't apply to most words with i and e paired together),
            but having multiple prounciations and 1000s of symbols to memorize is on a whole different level. I guess there's a reason why Japanese is considered one of the "impossible" languages.

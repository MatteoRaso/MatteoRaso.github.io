    <p>I was taking a look at my old GBA, and I couldn't help but think about how
much technology has advanced since it came out. It's been 20 years since that
came out, so according to Moore's Law, modern hardware is 1024x better now.
Seriously, our phones are better than our computers from just a decade ago.
If that's the case, why has mobile gaming been so awful? I know nostalgia is
a huge factor for why I look so fondly at the GBA, but mobile gaming being
an absolute garbage fire is a very common opinion, and with good reason.
Most mobile games (at least the successful ones) are more focused on increasing
metrics like retention and downloads instead of actually being fun, with
profits coming from actively ruining the player experience by shoving ads
down your throats or literally making you addicted through in-game gambling.
It's such a shame that an avenue for gaming that's over 1000 times as strong
as the GBA is being put to waste like this.</p>

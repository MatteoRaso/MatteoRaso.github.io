    <p>Yeah, it was definitely janky, but it's incredible that the devs were
able to make an AI that could respond to what the player says all the
way back in 2005. Another problem was that the devs were limited by
the number of lines that they could get the actors to record, so the
dialogue had to be constricted. It would be amazing if somebody tried
to make a spiritual sequel that uses audio deepfakes for voice acting
and some sort of LLM to handle the responses.</p>

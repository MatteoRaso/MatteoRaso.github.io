    <p>I decided to make an AI that predicts the quality of red wine recently.
The first step I took was to remove unnecessary features, which I did by 
using an ANOVA test. I found that residual sugars didn't have an impact on 
wine quality, so I removed it to make my data less sparse. After that, I 
removed the wines with a quality of 3, 4, and 8. The rationale was that 
there should be 10 observations per feature, which means a minimum of 100 
observations a label. There were less than 100 wines with a quality of 3, 
4, and 8 combined, so they weren't usable. After that, I used a Knn 
algorithm to classify them. It took a bit of playing around with the code, 
but I was able to get an AI that recorded an accuracy of 72.5%. Based on 
looking through the code of other people who used the same dataset, it 
seems that this is something of an upper limit for accuracy with this 
dataset.</p>

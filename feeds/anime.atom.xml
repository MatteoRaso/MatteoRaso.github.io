I enjoyed it, and I certainly didn't regret watching it, but it's not the groundbreaking anime that everybody seems to think that it is. It's just a normal mecha with slightly deep themes. The plot was convoluted and a lot of questions get left unanswered, which gives a lot of room for fan discussion but ultimately just made it a pain to watch at times. The ending was actually fantastic and redeemed the entire show for me, but then the studio decided to undermine that with a series of movies designed to please the fans that hated the ending. To be fair, I've heard that EoE was really good, but I've also heard a lot of bad things about Rebuild. I'll probably do a review of EoE one day, but that still doesn't change the fact that the original anime was underwhelming compared to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it's super creepy how the fanbase is obsessed with discussing which 14 year old is hotter. Even if I was a hardcore fan, I would shy away from revealing that just because the fanbase is seriously that obsessed and I wouldn't want people to think that of me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Anime"></category></entry></feed>
